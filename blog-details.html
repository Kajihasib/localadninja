              <b>2) The Conversion Rate is Very low</b>
              <p>
                You might have a list of hundreds of ideal prospects, but the
                reality is that conversion rates with cold calls are very low
                compared to many other methods of marketing.
              </p>
              <p>
                The reason is that businesses receive hundreds of calls every
                day so they might not have time to hear what you have to say or
                just aren’t interested. Furthermore, it’s very difficult to
                catch any decision-maker at a time when he or she isn’t busy.

        <p>
          We could try to sell you on our services all day through our website,
          but we don't like that approach. We'd rather set up a phone call &
          have a quick chat to see if we'd be a good fit for each other.
